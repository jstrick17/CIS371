        <p1 class="Area7">This is a smaller sentence. Followed by a slightly 
            longer sentence. Which is then followed by a much longer sentence 
            that could be considered a run on sentence.</p1>
        <p2 class="Area7">This is an example of a paragraph. The paragraph here is
            just a place holder to show that I know how to use a few tags. 
            The tags inclue i, b, and code.</p2>
        <p3 class="Area7">A paragraph is a coherent block of text, such as a group 
            of related sentences that develop a single topic or a coherent part 
            of a larger topic. A blank line contains zero or more non-printing 
            characters, such as space or tab, followed by a new line.</p3>
        <p4 class="Area7">She tried to explain that love wasn't like pie. There 
            wasn't a set number of slices to be given out. There wasn't less to 
            be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another. That 
            after a set amount was given out it would all disappear. She tried 
            to explain this, but it fell on deaf ears.</p4>

        <p class="Area3">Within the first area, I simply added the img attribute and made 
            sure that it had a maximum height of 100px as stated. Unfortunately, I could 
            not get my picture to show, so we get the broken img picture and the alt text
            For area 2, I used h1 to state my name and h2 to state the fake phone number. 
            Unfortunately, I could not get h1 to show up with h2. For area 4, I created a 
            table using the table attribute, table row, as well as the table data cell elements.
            These elements come in handy when attempting to create a table and want to lay your 
            data out more clearly. For area 5, I inserted the picture as stated, just like I did
            in area 1. Unfortunately again, I could not get the image link correct. For area 6,
            I was able to create a list using the ul command, or unordered list, and then used 
            the li command to fill in each point in the list with abbreviations of companies and
            could link those texts with the site of the company. Area 7 I was able to write out 
            each paragraph but was not able to use the b, i, or code attributes. For area 8, 
            again, I was unable to produce an image because I did not get the correct link.
            However, I was able to produce 5 links to the social media based off of the "pictures".</p>
