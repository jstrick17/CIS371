        <p5 class="Area3">This website was very fun to build. Having taken an HTML and CSS class
            I thought that this would be a breeze, but, these are different concepts than I was taught.
            For the first area, I was able to insert an image (using img) of my dad and I when he was one of my 
            hockey coaches in high school. I used the height attribute to set the height to 100px as 
            stated. For area 2, I was able to use the h1 and h2 attributes to display my full name, fake 
            phonenumber, and a phone icon. I could not get them both to display unless I used the span 
            attribute and put the class within the span. For area 4, I created a table using the attributes 
            table, tr, and td. Table creates the table, tr are the table rows, and td is each element 
            within the table. I chose classes at random from my MyPath through GVSU Banner. I also included
            the nth child pseudo class to alternate the background of the table rows from red to black. After
            I finished that, I used the hover pseudo class to change the background color of the elements 
            to blue when you hover over them. For area 5, I inserted a picture of a computer network, this
            relates to the networking classes that I have taken at GVSU. I was also able to center the picture 
            using flex and align-items: center;. For Area 6 I used an unordered list of ul to create a list 
            of abbreviated company names. I then used the anchor attribute and href to link the respective 
            companies websites. For Area 7, I used a random paragraph generator to generate random paragraphs 
            that I could throw into each p (paragraph). I then italicized (i), bolded (b), and used the code 
            attribute. For Area 8 I took mostly suggested social medias, attached a picture using the img tag
            and linked those pictures to their respective websites using the anchor tag and href. I then used 
            flex to center the pictures vertically and space each picture evenly apart.
